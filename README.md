## What is gnssr4river?

gnssr4river is a free and open-source Python toolbox that helps to:
- find suitable locations for placing a low-cost GNSS receiver to perform GNSS reflectometry
- assess rivers stages height using SNR data (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)

## Documentation and examples

A Notebook example that explains the different features of the toolbox can be found [here](docs/example.ipynb). It countains basics example of every function. 

Another Notebook ready to use can be found [here](docs/guideline.ipynb). It aims to provide various information for a given location, including the reflection points, the optimal height of the antenna, and potential additional data such as intersection with rivers and altimeter tracks.

## How to use it
